## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

### What I learned

I learned that I could change the styles of the children when you hover on their parent container. For example, 
```html
<section>
  <h2>Hello</h2>
  <p>World</p>
</section>
```

```css
section:hover p{
  color: blue;
}
```

In the above code, when section is hovered, the color of the `<p>` tag changes to blue without directly being hovered on.

## Acknowledgments

I was tied down on how to make the ```creation-name``` change after hovering on the image itself but with a few digging here and there, I found [Valeriia's](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Magic1vy) code solution which gave me an idea of how to make that feature work.
